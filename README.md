### TODOs

A few things could be improved with more time
 - Add tests using jest, react-testing-library/enzyme and cypress
 - Loader code uses css and animates the width of the arrow to create loading effect. Probably best to find a way to animate css `transform` property as thats more perfomant (also loader and timer go out of sync after awhile. Needs fixing... or maybe its a feature ðŸ¤”)
 - Display earnings in a more nicer way, than just logging them
 - Maybe add some sort of deployment pipeline. Nice easy choice would be [serverless components](https://github.com/serverless/components)
